                    <div>
                        <p>
                            For this sprint, similar to the last sprint, it was the last week to do QAs and
                            fix any bugs we found for the final build on the showcase. Thus, self-playtesting
                            and attending the remote playtesting session by advisors were great for tackling with
                            remaining bugs.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Programming, and Bug fixes (8 hours)</h3>
                        <p>
                            The tasks I mostly worked on for this last sprint were to fix bugs specifically the health transitions
                            between encounters using the saving and loading mechanics.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Ship Health Transition between Encounters
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The ship's health should be transferred the as the player progress through the encounters. Meaning that
                            when the player finishes with 50% hp for the first level, the 50% hp will be transferred to the next level
                            and the player should approach the next level more carefully. However, for the build I playtested, the
                            health did not transfer to the next level and started with the max level always. As a result, it makes
                            our game way easier because even if your ship were close to getting destroyed, only if you can survive the current
                            level, the ship's health will be reset to the max health. This was not our intended design, thus, I had to
                            fix this bug using the save and loading system written by another programmer Howard.
 
                            Reading and understanding the codebase written by someone else for the first time surely was challenging
                            but asking questions and reading the comments left by the original programmer helped me to comprehend and
                            fix the bug.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, Here's a short footage of <b>Ship Health</b> getting transferred to the next level without any issue:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:center;">
                            <video width="800" height="600" controls>
                                <source src="devblog/sprint6/health.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you can see from the demo, the current health of the ship now transfers from encounter 1 to the
                            shop and then from the shop to encounter 2. This would allow the player to use the pausing the
                            game by pressing the spacebar to strategize their plan to maintain the ship's health for the longer
                            survivability.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Ship Door Jamming Visual Indicator
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            In the previous blog post, I mentioned that I fixed the door jamming function that doors in the
                            player ship get jammed when a crew passes through it however there's no visual indicator that represents
                            if the door has been jammed. Therefore, for better UX, I added a yellow visual indicator for a door that got jammed for
                            5 seconds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And here is footage of the <b>the visual indicator</b> when a door gets jammed:
                        </p>
                         <p style="text-align:center;">
                            <video width="800" height="600" controls>
                                <source src="devblog/sprint6/door_indicator.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            Your browser does not support the video tag.
                            </video>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you can see, the jammed door is highlighted in yellow. So the player should be able to click the door
                            to close the door to prevent any hazards to spread to other rooms.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Playtesting (3 hours and 30 minutes)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since this was the final sprint, the playtesting was very important for finding any last-minute
                            bugs and report them on Jira. Therefore, while I was also fixing the bugs that I was assigned to, I
                            also playtested at the same time to find any bugs that might cause issues during the showcase. <br>
                           
                            In addition, I attended a few remote playtesting sessions by advisors to gain helpful feedback and
                            how they feel about our game in general.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Meetings (2 hours 45 minutes)</h3>
                        <p>For 2.75 of my 12 hours of bi-weekly involvement, I spent my time for the last studios meeting
                            for this project at the BBB. We did the last-minute playtesting for both projects and gather
                            into the department meeting to go over the feedback for the studio this semester so that
                            it can be improved in the future semester.  <br/>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I attended the 494 + EMU showcase on Friday 12/10 as a dev to show the games I worked on including this project and my EECS 494 final project.

                        </p>
                            I had a lot of fun at the showcase! I was able to meet with many different people and have them play Project Light and
                            my EECS 494 final project. It's been a long journey since the summer of 2022 I joined the studios as a programmer to work on
                            this project. My journey of Project Light might end here but I keep pursuing my game development journey and I hope
                            to be a part of the WolverineSoft Studios again in the future!
